# NETSCAPE BATTLEFRONT

Welcome to NETSCAPE BATTLEFRONT, an all vs 1 Real Time Strategy game where a single person attempts to hold off an invasion of creatures played by all of their friends, a perfect game for any large group or party!

## The Invaders

The team of invaders all log in to a locally hosted web client which acts as their controller and battlestation for the duration of the game.
Their role is to coordinate together and overwhelm the player by sending troops on the battlefield to take over the 4 control points on the map

## The Player
The player has direct access to the map and controls a character with resources and abilities they need to fight the invaders
